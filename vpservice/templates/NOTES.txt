Hope you alredy labeled one of the nodes with role ingress:
kubectl label node <node> role=ingress

If redis has been redeployed with cleaned up storage, grid need to be recreated.

Need to edit:
kc edit cm ingress-traefik -n kube-system

add this:
    [acme]
      email = "ilija.vukotic@cern.ch"
      storage = "acme.json"
      entryPoint = "https"
      ACMELogging = true
    [acme.tlsChallenge]
    [[acme.domains]]
      main = "vps.cern.ch"

then kill traefik containers.


If k8s cluster disapears and need to create it with new nodes, loadbalancer will still be there but with wrong members.

One need to add the new nodes:
export OS_REGION_NAME=sdn1 ; export OS_PROJECT_NAME="ATLAS Virtual Placement"
openstack loadbalancer member list 2995e682-0e3d-43c7-9841-0cfab1e7ab67
openstack  loadbalancer member create --protocol-port 443 --address 188.185.120.211 2995e682-0e3d-43c7-9841-0cfab1e7ab67

and delete old ones:
openstack loadbalancer member delete 2995e682-0e3d-43c7-9841-0cfab1e7ab67 <member id>
